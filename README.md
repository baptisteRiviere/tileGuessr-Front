# tileGuessr 2.0

tileGuessr is a simple web-based game where players have to find a location based on satellite images. This is a personal project developed by students at ENSG-GÃ©omatique school.

## How to Play

Once the game is running, players will be presented with a satellite image of a location, along with a map indicating the general area where the location is located. Players must then use their knowledge and intuition to guess the location by placing a marker on the map. The closer their guess is to the actual location, the more points they will earn.

Players can play as many rounds as they wish, with each round featuring a different location and a different score. The player's total score will be displayed at the end of each round.

## Architecture 

The second generation of the game is due to its new architecture into angular framework
